## Repository Description

Here you will find information on how to use GIT securely in development work.
This repository is the result of our team actively developing a pure GIT / GitHub infrastructure for repository optimization and automation during which we encountered security challenges.
Here we attempt to help any developer to use GIT and GitHub more securely.

This is a WIP repository where we will be adding new things as we keep developing:
Challenges that we are facing in terms of security will be registered here.

Topics that are covered among others:

- GPG and how we use it for projects
- GPG basic and more advanced uses in relation to GIT and GitHub.
- GitHub secrets, tokens, etc.
- GIT vs GitHub differences

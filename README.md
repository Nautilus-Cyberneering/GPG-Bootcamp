## Repository Description

Here you will find information on how to use GIT securely in development work.
This repository is the result of our team actively developing a pure GIT / GitHub infrastructure for repository optimization and automation during which we encountered security challenges.
Here we attempt to help any developer to use GIT and GitHub more securely.

This is a WIP repository where we will be adding new things as we keep developing.
Challenges that we are facing in terms of security will be registered here.

Topics that are covered among others:

- GPG and how we use it for projects.
- GPG basic and more advanced uses in relation to GIT and GitHub.
- GitHub secrets, tokens, etc.
- GIT vs GitHub differences.
- etc.

You can find all the articles here:
